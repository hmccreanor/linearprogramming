# Simplex Algorithm

Not really too sure what this is really... Basically (for now) if you hard code in the constructed tableu, variable indices and slack variable indices, the module runs the simplex algorithm on the tableu and returns the optimal values required to maximise the function.

It uses numpy arrays because they are fast so make sure you download that if you want to use this module.

I will try and build an inequality parser later in order to generate the tableu and indices for you.
